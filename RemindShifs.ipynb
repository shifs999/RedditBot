Unless you need a LGPL license (which only forces you to release the source code if you make changes to the Qt itself), either should be fine. PySide is \"the official\" package, but PyQt has thousands upon thousands of online material available which was built throughout the years.

For a real application made for other people to use, use anything else. PySide6 is a good choice.\n",
      "Reply0 : Thanks, that makes sense. I just saw some examples of PySide6 and it looks amazing. I hope to find a use case for that. I understand though that sometimes like C# (if we talk about Windows) is still way more common than to write a GUI in python. I rather aim to use Python for Data Engineering purpose but always good to be able to build some GUI.\n",

Making it look semi-decent is not that straightforward as well.

But even still you have to be very careful, I have noticed it tends to default to overly complex solutions, and doesn’t really have a great sense for honing in on the exact problem. You’re likely to get a lot of other garbage slipped in there that you don’t need. If taken at face value, this quickly leads to complex and incohesive codebase.\n",
